# Custom Book App (Client-side)

**Authors**: Jacob Perez and Liz Petersen

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Our app was initial created for storing book objects in a database. The client can make a request to the server for retrieval of all books, which will then be rendered as a list in the browser. 

This is the front end. Back end code can be found [here](https://github.com/acl-custom-cards/custom-cards-server).

## Getting Started
- To contribute, first `fork` and `clone` this repo.

## Architecture
Using jQuery and handlebarsJS. Deployed using gh-pages.

## Credits and Collaborations
S/O to ACL's 301 Day class instructor, Sarah Joy Calpo, Fall of 2017; our T/As: Haley Tortorella, Emily Cain, and Kayla (last name,please).
