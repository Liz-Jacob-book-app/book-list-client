# Custom Book App (Client-side)

**Authors**: Jacob Perez and Liz Petersen

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
Our app was initial created for storing book objects in a database. The client can make a request to the server for retrieval of all books, which will then be rendered as a list in the browser. 

This is the front end. The deployed app can be found here: https://liz-jacob-book-app.github.io/book-list-client/

Back end code can be found here: https://github.com/Liz-Jacob-book-app/book-list-server. This has not yet been deployed.
